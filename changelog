added submitPost.php: submits get data as thread
added script.js: 2 functions so far, 1. makes all links with the id "loadMe" use ajax "load" method for loading
added forum.php: thus far form that sends data via get link through jquery "load" method. jquery located in script.js
updated header.php: added welcome message into hidden div, then used data of welcome message to rid repeated data error, 
	created sub body div named pagediv to allow for easy jquery linking
	
needs Fixed:
	-constant reloading bug: when submitting form data (chrome and firefox) the form submits a blank form multiple times
		possible resolution: limit load functionality by unix timestamp
		
	 -IE toolbar duplication: when loading ajax'd pages, page fails to load in IE, displays duplicate of header even with "include once"
		possible resolution: add proper html markup
			honest resolution: switch to a better browser
			
	-persona login failure: unless initial page, cannot log in with persona in firefox or chrome once visiting jquery'd pages
		possible resolution: don't use that which you don't understand.
		
needs tested:
	security of persona
	
	stress test of system
	
To Do:
	-solve persona bug
		see if changing from include_once to require_once for the scripts avoids the repeated data bug that was present. 
	-see if I solve constant reload bug...
		resolution should be. see if data exists within div, if so, load div, if not, don't load
		should be resolved, needs tested
		
	
	-figure out how to increment given sql data for use in thread number
	
	-call data in main forum page
		create algorithm to sort by latest post etc. 
	
	plan logic for "multiple forums"
