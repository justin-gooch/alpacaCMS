changelog

5-8-13 7:58 am

added submitPost.php: submits get data as thread
added script.js: 2 functions so far, 1. makes all links with the id "loadMe" use ajax "load" method for loading
added forum.php: thus far form that sends data via get link through jquery "load" method. jquery located in script.js
updated header.php: added welcome message into hidden div, then used data of welcome message to rid repeated data error, 
	created sub body div named pagediv to allow for easy jquery linking
	
needs Fixed:
	-constant reloading bug: when submitting form data (chrome and firefox) the form submits a blank form multiple times
		possible resolution: limit load functionality by unix timestamp
		
	 -IE toolbar duplication: when loading ajax'd pages, page fails to load in IE, displays duplicate of header even with "include once"
		possible resolution: add proper html markup
			honest resolution: switch to a better browser
			
	-persona login failure: unless initial page, cannot log in with persona in firefox or chrome once visiting jquery'd pages
		possible resolution: don't use that which you don't understand.
		
needs tested:
	security of persona
	
	stress test of system
	
To Do:
	-solve persona bug
		see if changing from include_once to require_once for the scripts avoids the repeated data bug that was present. 
	-see if I solve constant reload bug...
		resolution should be. see if data exists within div, if so, load div, if not, don't load
		should be resolved, needs tested
		
	
	-figure out how to increment given sql data for use in thread number
	
	-call data in main forum page
		create algorithm to sort by latest post etc. 
	
	plan logic for "multiple forums"
		possible solution: multiple tables, shown by user privilege, etc
		
	
for now only fantasy
	add profile pictures
	
	add unique usernames
	
	add titles in forum
	
	use feeltronic source, ajax it up; give jack ajax'd up source, add options for verified members to upload videos
	
	
5-8-13 6:23 pm update

fixed:

	constant reload bug resolved, added if statement and made page only work with ajax style 
	
	persona bug resolved solution was to make pages only contain needed information instead of contantly reloading through include since
		jquery doesn't handle it very well
		
	added sql field incrementer for thread id. 
	
5-19-13 8:29 pm
	added viewed threads option which highlights in "smoke white" which threads have and have not been viewed. 
	
	reply for individual threads and creating threads works
	
	still need to create profile for individual users. 
	
	still need to add security against malicious html to forum posts and replies (server side)
	
	perhaps have forums listed by permission. so that way there are private and public forums. 
	
	having profile pictures may be unneccissary but it may make the experience better over all. 
	
current goals (in order)
	get profile working 
	-its rough but works
	
	figure out different setting options for profile (decide how far we are going with profiles) 
	-we have a rough idea of how this could work. so far its simply changing the name which is all we need. 
	
	-0 new member
	-1 new member with nickname chosen
	-2 club member
	-3 club member elite
	-4 moderator
	-5 admin
	
	create definition of user powers
	-see above
	
	add blog post type deal by officer rank that uploads on main page. 
	-blog submission done, needs tested, needs place to upload stuff to(possibly home page?);
	
	add customized menu bar for different items(like for example an admin panel etc)
	-as a note, this is done fairly easily... (see header)
	
	add calendar 
	
	add youtube playlist uploadable by rank 3+ individuals. 
	
	update design principles of site
